# Code Cheatsheets

This is a collection of code cheatsheets that I've written to easily remember
the commonly used syntax of a language or software. This is
not meant to be a complete reference, but a quick guide to easily write code.
I'll be constantly updating this list as I learn new stuff.

## Quick Setup

To view this site locally, just download the [cheatsheets](https://github.com/karloespiritu/CheatSheets) GitHub repo and run it locally.

```bash
~ gem install jekyll
~ git clone git@github.com:karloespiritu/cheatsheets.git
~ cd cheatsheets
~ jekyll serve
# => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```
