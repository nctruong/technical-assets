Here are some of the Git commands that I often use.

## Basic

Display local repo config settings

```bash
git config --list
```

Show remote repository URL

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
# or
git remote show origin
```

Change origin URL

```bash
git remote set-url origin http//github.com/repo.git
```

Add remote repo

```bash
git remote add remote-name https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

Check remote repository URL of current repo

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

Syncing a fork

```bash
//Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository. Commits to master will be stored in a local branch, upstream/master
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```

View Change Log

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate --color
```

## Refactor filenames

```bash
// Deletes file from working directory and stages the deletion
git rm <filename>

// Removes file from version control but preserves file locally
git rm --cached <filename>

// Changes file name and prepares it for commit
git mv <filename-orig> <filename-renamed>

```

## Commits

If you want to see what you haven't `git add`ed yet:

```bash
git diff -- myfile.txt
```

If you want to see already-added changes

```bash
git diff --cached -- myfile.txt
```

Unstage a file for commit

```bash
git reset <file>
```

Combining commits

```bash
//Interactive rebasing of last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

//Tells Git to combine all 3 commits into the 1st commit
pick 01d112s New header design
squash 63423aa Added search bar
squash ebfd157 Updated header icon
```

Change last commit message

```bash
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

Discard all local changes

```bash
git reset --hard
```

Undo last commit & redo

```bash
git commit ...                (1)
git reset --soft HEAD~1       (2)
<< edit files as necessary >> (3)
git add ....                  (4)
git commit -c ORIG_HEAD       (5)
```

## Stash

Temporarily stash changes, apply later

```bash
// Stash current changes
git stash

//List all stashed changesets
git stash list

# Do some new changes

// Apply stashed changes
git stash apply
```


## Manage Branches

Reset local repo to match remote repo

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```

Pull latest changes from a remote repo

```bash
git fetch
git pull
```

Delete a local branch

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

Delete a remote branch

```bash
git push origin :remote_branch
```

## Merging a finished feature branch

The `--no-ff` flag causes the merge to always create a new commit object, even if the merge could be performed with a fast-forward. This avoids losing information about the historical existence of a feature branch and groups together all commits that together added the feature.

```bash
git co develop
git merge --no-ff myfeature
git branch -d myfeature
git push origin develop
```

## Create a release branch

```bash
git checkout -b release-1.2 develop
./bump-version.sh 1.2
git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2"
```

## Finishing a release branch

```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release-1.2
git tag -a 1.2
```

To keep the changes made in the release branch, we need to merge those back into develop, though.

```bash
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release-1.2
// delete release branch, no longer needed
git branch -d release-1.2
```

## Creating a hotfix branch

```bash
git checkout -b hotfix-1.2.1 master
./bump-version.sh 1.2.1
git commit -a -m "Bumped version number to 1.2.1"
```

Donâ€™t forget to bump the version number after branching off.

```bash
git commit -m "Fixed severe production problem"
```

## Finishing a hotfix branch

```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1
git tag -a 1.2.1

// include fix into develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.2.1.2
git branch -d hotfix-1.2.1
```
